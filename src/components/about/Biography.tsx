      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        Abel Lema is a young upcoming contemporary Ethiopia artist based in
        Addis Abeba. He grew up surrounded by the area's picturesque lakes and
        breathtaking natural scenery. He often describes this early connection
        with nature as his first source of artistic inspiration. Abel views
        himself as interconnected with all living beings, sharing the present
        and eternal moments of life, a philosophy that deeply influences his
        artistic perspective and approach.

        commodification in contemporary society. Through his work, Abel immers
        into the paradoxes of time and humanity's divine impulse not only to
        create but to become the architects of our own realities.
